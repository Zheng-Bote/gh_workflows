# HowTo docs

## short

- organize your content in folders
- add one or more files to a folder
- don't name your files README.md

## long

**docs-as-code** approach (see also: [Documentation As Code](https://docs-as-co.de/))

Handle your (developer) documentation like code.

- checkout the branch _gh-pages_
- add / modify content
- push it into the repo
- wait 1 or 2 minutes (workflow index, pushlish to pages)
